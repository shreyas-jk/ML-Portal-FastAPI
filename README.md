# Goal
A complete end-to-end machine learning portal that covers processes starting from model training to model predicting results using FastAPI. 

# Workflow
- Import/upload dataset
- Preprocessing
  - Categorical features cleaning
  - Handling missing value (categorical)
  - Handling missing value (numeric)
  - Encoding cateogrical feature
  - Over sampling
  - Clustering
  - Train-Test split
  - Model selection
    - Hyper parameter tuning
  - Saving best model
  - Download prediction results
